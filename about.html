<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>My name is Brittny Lapierre and I'm a student studying Computer Science at <a href="http://carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>.</p>
<h3>I Love to Learn</h3>
<p>I'm a UX enthusiast; I love learning how to make interacting with computers and software a positive experience for everyone. I'm an aspiring full stack developer; my curiosity and eagerness to learn about technology extends to every level of software development. Oh and if you couldn't tell from the title of my website, I also love cappuccinos.</p>
<p>I chose to join the <a href="https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/#Computer_Science__Psychology_Stream__BCS_Honours">Psychology Stream of Computer Science</a> at my school in order to better understand how to design software for people, and how to best work with others to achieve our goals. I hope to learn about Network Computing through some of my upper year electives, and I would like to further my knowledge in communication as well. I'd like to study communication to both express my ideas clearly and to learn about how people connect with others through social media.</p>
<p>I think my passion for Computer Science stems from my love of learning. In our field our tools are constantly evolving and to be as effective as you can be, you must evolve along with them.</p>
<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
<h4>Tools Developer Co-op</h4>
<p>I have a years worth of professional experience as a Tools Developer Co-op for Ericsson Canada where I was able to design and develop programs and web dashboards for my co-workers. After gaining the confidence I needed through my co-op position, I have been seeking out new opportunities to develop my skills.</p>
<h4>Web Assistant</h4>
<p>I've obtained a position as a Web Assistant for The School of Journalism and Communication at Carleton University, where I'm helping in the process of updating and upgrading their web app for apprenticeships.</p>
<h3>Extra-Curriculars</h3>
<h4>Design Team Lead</h4>
<p>I met some amazing people during co-op, like my good friend who taught me about the Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS). After being inspired by her, I decided to get involved and I am now the head of their Design Team. We work on creative projects for the CCSS such as photography, videography, and web design and development. On my off time, I also volunteer as the head of The Lounge, a place where Computer Science students go to hang out on campus.</p>
<h4>SSSC Mentor and Computer Science Team Co-Coordinator</h4>
<p>I've also decided to try and help students who need guidance by becoming a mentor for The Science Student Success Center. I was given the position of Computer Science Team Co-coordinator along with my mentorship position. As a Co-coordinator for the SSSC I help plan workshops and events for Computer Science Students, and as a mentor, I give one on one mentoring sessions to any student in the Faculty of Science who needs encouragement and  moral support.</p>
<h4>UX Peer Helper</h4>
<p>Lastly, I found a unique opportunity as a Peer Helper for the Office of the Vice President through the Peer Helper Program. After mentioning my interest in UX and web development, they offered to have me help plan new features for Carleton's 'Current Students' website. What initially was a social media marketing position has now transformed into a role where I get to practice designing user interfaces and get more experience in thinking for the end user.</p>
<h3>Anything Else?</h3>
<p>Other things I love to do are drawing and hanging out with my closest friends and family. I also like watching cartoons and anime, and other shows like Doctor Who. I have three cats (yes, three) who I'm sure you'll get to know better if you read my blog posts. I guess it goes without saying that I love animals.</p>
<p>I hope to get into 3D modeling and printing; I think it'd be so cool to design little figurines! I also want to get into using dip pens for inking like comic book artists and mangaka. I love the styles.</p>
<p>Some other things that I love are the outdoors, healthy (okay, maybe just all) food, and learning about other cultures.</p>
