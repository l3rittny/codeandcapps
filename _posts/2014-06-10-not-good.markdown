<h3>Welcome to my online journal.</h3>
<p>Or blog as they call it.</p>
<p>The concept of me writing down my thoughts and publishing them online is very new and strange to me. I feel as time goes by and I become more comfortable, my posts will become better and better. For now though, you're stuck with newbie Brittny.</p>
